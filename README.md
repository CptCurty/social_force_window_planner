# social_force_window_planner (**ROS2 Foxy version**)
A local controller based on Dinamic Window Approach (DWA) and Social Force Model (SFM) has been developed to command a differential robot in a socially-compliant way.

This planner projects a set of possible trajectories in a small lookahead time (*sim_time* parameter). Then, the SFM is employed as a predictor of the future state of the surrounding people along the trajectories.

Besides the basic scoring function to follow the global path, a new social cost has been added. It is based on the concept of the "**social work**" performed by the robot ($W_{r}$), and the social work provoked by the robot in the surrounding pedestrians ($W_{p}$)

$$ W_{social} = W_{r} + \sum W_{p_{i}} $$

With:

- $W_{r}$  The summatory of the modulus of the robot social force and the robot obstacle force along the trajectory. According to the SFM.
- $W_{p}$  The summatory of the modulus of the social forces provoked by the robot for each close pedestrian along the trajectory. According to the SFM.

This local planner has been programmed as a Controller plugin under ROS2 distro foxy. So it can be used in the ROS2 *nav2* architecture. The possible collisions are checked based on the ROS local costmap and the projected people positions.

## Dependencies

- lightsfm (https://github.com/robotics-upo/lightsfm).
  
- Packages of ROS2 nav2 (https://navigation.ros.org/index.html).

- Any sofware providing people detections. It should publish people_msgs/People messages in any topic (/people by default).


## TO DO List:

The package is a **work in progress** used in research prototyping. Pull requests and/or issues are highly encouraged.

- [ ] Improve the approximation to a final goal.
- [ ] Larger *sim_time* and *wp_tolerance* gives more "social" freedom to the planner but it presents problems to overcome some corners and narrow passages. We must try to fix this or to find a good balance. 
- [X] Fix the computation of the robot local goal in the path in case the robot moves farther than *wp_tolerance* distance.
